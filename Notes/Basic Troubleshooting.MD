### Basic troubleshooting

#### Just installed it, and many websites are broken

Please switch your script host to Tampermonkey and try again. 

#### Just installed it, it does nothing at all, warnings on the home page does not disappear

Please read the installation instructions again and see if you missed something. This could be caused by unsupported setup, please 
configure it more like the [standard setup](https://github.com/jspenguin2017/AdBlockProtector/blob/master/Notes/Standard%20Setup.MD) 
and try again. 

#### Just installed it, it fixed a few websites but not all

Please read the [contribution guideline](https://github.com/jspenguin2017/AdBlockProtector/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.MD) 
and open an issue.
