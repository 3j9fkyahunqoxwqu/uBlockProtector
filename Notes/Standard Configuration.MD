# The standard configuration

This is the standard configuration, I will use this configuration for all my tests. 
I may not fix issues that I cannot reproduce and I may not accept solutions that fail in my tests. 

### Everything updated to the latest stable version

## Chrome: 

Settings under `Privacy -> Content settings...`, `Network`, and `HTTPS/SSL` are left as default. 

`Privacy -> Send a "Do Not Track" request with your browsing traffic` enabled. 

`System -> Use hardware acceleration when available` left as default. 

Settings in `chrome://flags/` page are left as default.
