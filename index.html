            <h2>Why use AdBlockers? </h2>
            <p>Ads are important for websites to sustain themselves. However, some websites use ads that are annoying or even force the user to click them. If you believe websites should be allowed to use any form of ads they want, then many websites use tracking methods to display targeted ads, and that can go wrong. The company might promise you to only use that information for targeted ads, but why should you trust them? You should have the control over your privacy, and choose which website to trust. Recently, many websites start to employ methods to detect AdBlockers and ask or sometimes even force the user to disable them. The good news is, there are ways to protect AdBlockers from being detected. </p>

            <p>Most protectors such as Anti-AdBlock Killer are very large, where efficiency and compatibility will be an issue. Our project focus on make it work until it is properly implemented into those large projects. </p>
            <p>Some of our codes will be quite inneficient, but that is the tradeoff for quick solutions. </p>
