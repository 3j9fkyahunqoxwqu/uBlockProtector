Code from Anti-Adblock Killer inherits its original license: https://github.com/reek/anti-adblock-killer/blob/master/LICENSE

Unless otherwise specified, everything else (starting version 4.0) falls under GNU GPL v3 license. 

### Possible optimizations

1. `a.filter()` takes in RegExp but RegExp is only needed once
2. `a.out` master switch?
3. Remove `a()` and `a.VERSION`?
