Code from Anti-Adblock Killer inherit its original license: https://github.com/reek/anti-adblock-killer/blob/master/LICENSE

Unless otherwise specified, everything else (starting version 4.0) falls under GNU GPL v3 license. 

### Possible optimizations

1. `a.out` master switch
2. `a.filter()` takes in RegExp but it's ~~not really needed~~ only needed once
3. Remove `a()` (and `a.VERSION`?)
