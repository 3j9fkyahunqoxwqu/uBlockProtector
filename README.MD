## Building

We use custom compilers, the source code for the compilers along with prebuilt binaries for Windows 10 are 
located in `Script Compiler` and `List Compiler` folders. 

The compilers are built with Visual Studio 2017. 

## License

Many solutions are reimplemented based on [Anti-Adblock Killer](https://github.com/reek/anti-adblock-killer) (by Reek). 

Compilers and Script Core are under GNU GPL v3 license unless otherwise specified. 

Everything else inherits Anti-Adblock Killer's [license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)

## To-do

1. Decide which script host to support, update home page and standard setup, then add a link to the store.
