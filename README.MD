## Building

We use custom compilers, the source code for the compilers along with prebuilt binaries for Windows 10 are 
located in `Script Compiler` and `List Compiler` folders. 

The compilers are built with Visual Studio 2017. 

## License

Compilers and Script Core are under GNU GPL v3 license. Everything else inherits Anti-Adblock Killer's

## To-do

1. Decide which script host to support, update home page and standard setup, then add a link to the store.
