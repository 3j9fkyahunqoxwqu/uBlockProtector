## Opening an issue

### Reporting a website that does not work

First, please check if someone else already opened an issue for your problem, join the discussion there and do not open another issue 
if that is the case. 

**Title**: The domain of the website. Prepend `NSFW! ` if the website may contain contents that are not safe for work. 

**Comment**: Please provide: 

* A test link
* Whether you are using the [standard setup](https://github.com/jspenguin2017/AdBlockProtector/blob/master/Notes/Standard%20Setup.MD)
* Everything else that you believe to be useful, this can include but not limited to screenshots and reproduction steps

Please note that you may submit an issue even if you are not using the standard setup, 
we will look into your issue as long as you are not using one of the setup that is known to not work 
(they are listed on our [home page](https://jspenguin2017.github.io/AdBlockProtector/)). 
But keep in mind that we may not fix issues that cannot be reproduced on the standard setup. 

### Reporting a bug

Give your issue a descriptive title and clearly explain what is wrong, include reproduction steps and screenshots if necessary. 

### Everything else

Give your issue a descriptive title and clearly explain what you are looking for.
