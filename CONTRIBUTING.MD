### You are prohibited from opening issues in this repository if you are not using Chromium / Chrome and uBlock Origin. 

### You must install and enable BOTH uBlock Protector List and uBlock Protector Extension. Everything must be updated to the latest stable version. 

### Installation instructions are on my [home page](https://jspenguin2017.github.io/uBlockProtector/). 

Note: Issues that are specific to Chromium may not be fixed as I cannot test on it. 

Check out [AdBlock Protector 2](https://adblockprotector2.github.io/AdBlockProtector2/) if you do not want to switch your setup.

This repository has these special rules because it starts to take a lot of my time. These rules only 
apply to **this** repository. These rules do not apply to myself and I reserve the right to change these 
rules at any time. 

Consequence for breaking these rules varies from a warning to a 6 months ban on a case by case basis. 
Be aware that the ban will apply to all of my repositories. I will not ban people easily, but when I do, 
expect it to be at least 1 month. 

There is no arguing about these rules, the Fork button is always available if you do not like these rules. 

You are not allowed to promote proprietary software in this repository, and you are expected to stay somewhat on topic. 

## Opening an issue

**If your screenshots are not safe for work, you must wrap them in `<details></details>`.**

### Reporting a website that does not work

**Check if someone else already opened an issue for your problem**, join the discussion there and do not open another one. 

**Missed ads and popups are to be reported to [EasyList](https://forums.lanik.us/) or 
[uAssets](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/issues) first**, 
only open issue about them here if: 
* uBlock Protector caused them to be unblocked, or 
* Blocking them triggers anti-adblock, or 
* They cannot be blocked with just filters 

**Title of your issue**: The domain of the website. Prepend `NSFW! ` if the website may contain contents that are not safe for work. 
Prepend `URGENT! ` if the issue is caused by uBlock Protector. 

An issue is considered caused by uBlock Protector if the issue persists after white listing the website but no longer occur once 
uBlock Protector Extension is disabled. Misusing `URGENT! ` title can lead to a ban. 

**Comment of your issue**: Use the template. Wrap links in backticks to make them not clickable. 

### Reporting a bug

Give your issue a descriptive title and clearly explain what is wrong, include reproduction steps and screenshots if necessary. 

### Reporting something secret

If what you are reporting needs to be secret (like an issue that requires an account to reproduce), open an issue in my 
[restricted issues tracker](https://gitlab.com/xuhaiyang1234/uBlockProtectorSecretIssues/issues). Do not forget to flag the 
issue as confidential. 

Since that issues tracker is not actively monitored, you also need to open an issue here to let me know. 

### Everything else

Give your issue a descriptive title and clearly explain what you are looking for. You are not allowed to ask for expanding 
supported setups nor for help with installation, one exception is when you are sure that the installation guide is broken. 

## Opening pull request

Take the time to understand this project, do not submit low quality Pull Requests. You should at least skim over everything 
before submitting your first Pull Request. Also, nicely comment your code and thoroughly explain what it does and why the 
change is necessary. Use the template if appropriate.
