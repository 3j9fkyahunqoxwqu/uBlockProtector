## Opening an issue

Please first have a look at our 
[basic troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/jspenguin2017/AdBlockProtector/blob/master/Notes/Basic%20Troubleshooting.MD). 

### Reporting a website that does not work

**Title**: The domain of the website. Prepend `NSFW! ` if the website may contain not safe for work content. 

**Comment**: Please provide: 

* A test link
* Whether you are using the [Standard Setup](https://github.com/jspenguin2017/AdBlockProtector/blob/master/Notes/Standard%20Setup.MD)
* Everything else that you believe to be useful, this can include but not limited to screenshots and reproduction steps

Please note that you may submit an issue even if you are not using the Standard Setup, 
we will look into your issue as long as you are not using one of the setup that is known to not work 
(they are listed on our [home page](https://jspenguin2017.github.io/AdBlockProtector/)). 
But keep in mind that we may not fix issues that cannot be reproduced on the Standard Setup. 

### Reporting a bug
