This repository has these special rules because it starts to take a lot of my time. These rules only 
apply to **this** repository. These rules do not apply to myself and I reserve the right to change these 
rules at any time. 

Consequence for breaking these rules varies from a warning to a 6 months ban on a case by case basis. 
Be aware that the ban will apply to all of my repositories. I will not ban people easily, but when I do, 
expect it to be at least one month. 

There is no arguing about these rules, with the only exception being recommendation on accepted setup, 
but be aware that there can be only one accepted setup. The Fork button is always available if you do not 
like these rules. 

You are not allowed to promote proprietary software anywhere in this repository, and you are expected to 
stay on topic. 

## Opening an issue

### Reporting a website that does not work

Check if someone else already opened an issue for your problem, join the discussion there and do not open another one. 

**Title**: The domain of the website. Prepend `NSFW! ` if the website may contain contents that are not safe for work. 

**Comment**: Use the template. 

### Reporting a bug

Give your issue a descriptive title and clearly explain what is wrong, include reproduction steps and screenshots if necessary. 

### Reporting something secret

If what you are reporting needs to be absolutely secret (e.g. security vulnerability), open an issue in our 
[restricted issues tracker](https://gitlab.com/xuhaiyang1234/uBlockProtectorSecretIssues/issues). 
Do not forget to flag the issue as confidential. 

Since that issues tracker is not actively monitored, you also need to open an issue here to let us know. 

### Everything else

Give your issue a descriptive title and clearly explain what you are looking for. 
You are not allowed to ask for expanding support nor for help with installation. 
One exception is if are sure that the installation guide is broken. 

## Opening pull request

Take the time to understand this project, do not submit low quality Pull Requests. You should at least skim over everything 
before submitting your first Pull Request. Also, nicely comment your code and thoroughly explain what it does and why the 
change is necessary.
